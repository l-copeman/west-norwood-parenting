# West Norwood Parenting

Welcome user,

West Norwood Parenting has been designed to bring parents together from the West Norwood area. With the demands of parenting, it can often be lonely and difficult to meet other parents, especislly for first-time parents. This site offers a range of classes, where you can take your children whilst meeting other parents at the same time. There is also a form where you can sign up to hear about social events for parents and upcoming classes.

The site can be accessed by this [link](https://l-copeman.github.io/west-norwood-parenting/)

## Design

### Colour

![Colours Screenshot](documentation/colours-screenshot.jpeg)

* Light pink colour was used for header and footer sections, as well as form background. I chose it because it evokes memories of childhood, whilst also being a warm and comforting colour.
* A dark blue colour was used for classes and responses pages background, as well as other details. I chose it because it contrasts well with the pink used and is associated with knowledge, authority, and reliability.
* A darker shade of pink was used on the classes page and sign-up page. This darker shade is a calming colour associated with love and kindness.

### Typography

![Font Screenshot](documentation/font-screenshot.jpeg)

### Wireframe

* I used Balsamiq to create wireframes of my ideas
